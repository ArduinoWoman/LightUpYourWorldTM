==================

Tech Museum of Innovation - Light Up Your World class 2014

This class will involve the most basic funciton of Arduino, to control and change lights. We'll be using LEDs where the electricity flows in one direction, and the fun radiates in all directions! Follow our 4 challenges to build your knowledge in electrical engineering and computer programming.


There is an update, a difference between using a TMP36 and a LM335.  I had written the #4 code for a TMP36, which would react quite nicely with our array of LEDs.  However, we actually got a LM335 in our kits which is just a whole different temperature sensor.  I'll try to post enough information and new code here to make it work on your end.

I will post
*a new Fritzing File
*new code
*most important close-up from the datasheet below
